/*
 * Tests TumblingWindowTopology - demonstrates Tumbling Time Windows with reduce()
 * 
 * Tumbling Windows:
 * - Fixed size, non-overlapping time windows
 * - Each record belongs to exactly one window
 * - Example: 60-second windows [0-60), [60-120), [120-180)...
 * 
 * Grace Period:
 * - Additional time after window end to accept late-arriving records
 * - Example: 20s grace means window [0-60) accepts records until 80s
 * - After grace period expires, window is closed and results are final

     * Creates topology that aggregates game scores within 60-second tumbling windows.
     * 
     * WINDOW SEMANTICS:
     * - Window size: 60 seconds (tumbling, non-overlapping)
     * - Grace period: 20 seconds for late-arriving records
     * - Records are grouped by game name (stream key)
     * - Scores are summed within each window per game
     * 
     * LATE RECORDS HANDLING:
     * - Late record: has event time (record timestamp) from window but arrives after window closes
     * - Grace period: 20s additional time for late records after window closes
     * - Example: window [0-60s), grace 20s â†’ record with event time 30s arriving at processing time 70s gets processed
     * - Records arriving after grace period (80s+) are dropped
